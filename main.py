'''
Write a function `print_multiples` with one parameters `n`.

When called, your function should print out ALL of the multiples of `n` between 0 and 100 (including both 0 and 100), and NO OTHER numbers.

Call your function for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, `n = 5`, and `n = 12`.

def print_multiples(n):
    for i in range(0, 101, n):  # making the number go from 1-100 using certain fucntions
        print(i)

# Testing the function with different values
print("Multiples of 2:")
print_multiples(2)

print("Multiples of 3:")
print_multiples(3)

print("multiples of 5:")
print_multiples(5)

print("Multiples of 12:")
print_multiples(12)
